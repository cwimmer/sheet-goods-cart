# On Components and Suppliers

## Suppliers

In the Bill of Materials, I sometimes list McMaster as the supplier.  You do not have to purchase the components from McMaster.  McMaster provides excellent specifications for all of their components.  McMaster links are an easy way to access specifications. You may select equivalent parts from any supplier.

When McMaster does not supply a specific part, I've included links to suppliers I've used.  These parts will fulfill the requirements of this design, but you may select equivalent parts from any supplier.

## Materials

### Fasteners

I've specified stainless steel fasteners.  You may choose any material you wish for your fasteners as long as you weigh the material change against your load requirements.

## Standards

All fasteners I've used in my testing conform to ISO 4762.
